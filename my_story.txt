My Story
By: Aaron and the Students of 98-174 F17

Chapter 1
---------
Once upon a time, a squirrel named Nibbles lived alone in a vast forest.
Every day, Nibbles would leave the safety of his home in the big oak tree
to search for acorns to save up for the long, cold winter.
One brisk October day, Nibbles was returning home with his cheeks full of
acorns. As he peeped into the entrance to his burrow, he gasped in surprise
at what he saw.

Chapter 2
---------
He saw a beautiful squirrel.
Facing him was his old, trusty mirror, smudged with the hours he spent gazing
into his own reflection. Sadly, he approached his reflection and stroked the
glass lightly with his paw. "You are beautiful and worthy of love," he whispered.
"Thanks, Nibbles," replied the mirror.
