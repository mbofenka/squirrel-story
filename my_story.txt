My Story
By: Aaron and the Students of 98-174 F17

Chapter 1
---------
Once upon a time, a squirrel named Nibbles lived alone in a vast forest.
Every day, Nibbles would leave the safety of his home in the big oak tree
to search for acorns to save up for the long, cold winter.
One brisk October day, Nibbles was returning home with his cheeks full of
acorns. As he peeped into the entrance to his burrow, he gasped in surprise
at what he saw.

Chapter 2
---------
Nibbles's father, Hudson, was leaning over a small, mangled lump of bloodstained fur. Nibbles let the acorns fall from his mouth and shifted towards the body to get a closer look. The body was another squirrel, just a child, whom Nibbles had never seen before. She was dying, that much Nibbles was sure of. The room was silent except for a soft hack hack hack coming from the dying squirrel as she tried to breathe. Nibbles was horrified by the sight, more than he had ever been in his life. He couldn't move. He couldn't speak. He could only watch the fear and soul leak out of her eyes until she was no more. A moment of silence passed before Nibbles could gather the air necessary to speak. "What was her name?"
Nibbles's father stared at the corpse, only shaking his head before letting out a breathy reply. "I don't know. I never saw her coming until it was too late for her."
Nibbles and Hudson buried the body deep in the thick of the apple orchard they called their home, got their stories straight, and never spoke of the events that occurred that day again. Nibbles tried to put the image of death out of his mind, but to this day, as he tries to fall into a state of sleep at night, he swears he can still hear the hack hack hack of the dead squirrel's final breaths.
